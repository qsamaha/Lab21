	<h2>Bootcamp</h2>
	<p>This Java Bootcamp at Grand Circus is the real deal Holyfield. Filling my brain with so much information on a daily basis feels like I'm taking my brain and putting it in a blender everyday. It's going to explode if I fill it with any more information. SIKE...Im ready for it all. Bring it! Easy Peazy Lemon Squeezy. I am very motivated and very determined to make myself a great developer. I fell in love with code at the first instance that I saw a line of code. It was truely love at first sight. Being a developer is like being married. You love it very much even though it costs you your sleep and mental sanity. </p>
