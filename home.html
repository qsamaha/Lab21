	<h1>Day in the Life of Q</h1>
	<p> Here I am living day to day. Staying busy, staying out the way. Working fourteens during the weekend and a couple of six hour shifts during the week. Going to this bootcamp.... coding and studying code 60+ hours a week. This is no joke. Nothing will break a real one though. Still up everyday ready for the day. Let's get it. Other than being enrolled in a coding bootcamp and working at the U of M in Ann Arbor as a Chef Assisstant, I am a boxer. I am in the gym as much as possible, before this bootcamp I was in the gym at least five to six days a week. I have not been in the gym since starting this bootcamp but its alright, as long as I complete this bootcamp and find a job it will all be worthwhile. </p>
