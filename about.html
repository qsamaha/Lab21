<h2>Ann Arbor</h2>
	<p>Ann Arbor born and raised. Im from the south side of Ann Arbor. From a neighborhood called Stony Brook, right there on Hemlock Dr. Ask about me. They say Ann Arbor soft, ya'll soft. Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan which is one of the most educated universities in the US. Working there is great and I work with some good people. They grew on me and working with them has become very fun even though we stay busy and get a lot done on a daily basis.</p>
